<p>4/25/23:</p>
<p>I had a schedule to update the website every 5 days until development ended. 
but I had to release 1.08 late.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>here is a chart of when I planned to release every version:</p>
<table border="1" width="100%">
	<tr>
		<td>version:</td>
		<td>date:</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1.0</td>
		<td>3/31/23</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1.05</td>
		<td>4/02/23</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1.06</td>
		<td>4/10/23</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1.07</td>
		<td>4/15/23</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>1.08</td>
		<td>4/20/23</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
